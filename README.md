# APK-upload-servlet
The two folders, namely Login and APK upload, have files related to servlets and HTML. The HTML page redirects the files or input from user to the servlets where processing is done and further response is generated for the user.

To use this, Apache tomcat is required. (https://tomcat.apache.org/download-60.cgi)
